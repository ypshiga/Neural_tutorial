# Neural_tutorial
 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch in python tutorial. ANN structure based on this Medium post https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6 and inputs based on this towards data science post https://towardsdatascience.com/artificial-neural-networks-for-total-beginners-d8cd07abaae4
 
 Uses a simple 2 layer set-up - one hidden layer with four nodes and one output layer. Both layers use a sigmoid activation function. Added a learning rate and may add a bias term.
